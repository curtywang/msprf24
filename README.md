nRF24L01+ Library for MSP430 Value Line and Launchpads

This library is an attempt to provide the TI MSP430 microcontroller platform a rich interface to the Nordic Semiconductor nRF24L01 and nRF24L01+ proprietary 2.4GHz RF digital transceivers. These transceivers are appropriate for transmitting digital data in one-to-one or many-to-one topologies over relatively short distances--typically up to 100 meters although some breakout boards make claims of 1km range (very dubious IMO). They are available through a few vendors although eBay contains plenty of listings from Shenzhen, China and Hong Kong for cheap breakout boards ranging from simplistic PCB trace-antenna designs to RP-SMA WiFi antenna-coupled boards with PA+LNA RF amplifiers onboard.
